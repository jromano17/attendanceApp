Attendance web application for university professors and guests.
This app was created for the course "Web Tehnologije" ("Web Technologies") on the third year of my degree.

It allows guests to view and navigate the possible courses they could attend when enrolled in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Sarajevo.
The app has another feature for the faculty's professors. They can enter their profile and choose to view the attendence for the subjects that they are teaching.
The professor can also modify the attendence for the students enrolled in those courses.
